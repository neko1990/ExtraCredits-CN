or teaches you something about yourself 
或者让你更加了解自己
recenty james was telling me of just such an experiece he had

a video game ask him a question he counld't answer
他被游戏中一个问题问倒了
he said he was playing the game , he reached the certain part 
他玩到一个地方
and then he just set the controler down and think 
不得不放下手柄 开始思考
he sat there cross leged poundering for more than half an hour 
他盘着腿思索了得有半小时
then he picked up the controler 
然后他又抄起手柄开始玩
he knew what to do ,or rather what he would do
他知道该怎么做，更准确地说他应该这么做
and then doing so, he learned something about himself

There comes a point at mass effect 2,
质量效应2 中有个场景
where the player is asked to decide the fate of a faction of the geth
玩家被问到如何决定一小撮geth族的命运
a sentient machine race 
geth族 ---> 一群AI
here's the setup
以下是简介
the geth were initially one unified group 
geth族最初是一个团结的集体
then they begin to have ideological and religious difference
然后他们有了思想意识以及宗教上的差异 [repeater改造的结果]
now one sect of the geth has come to believe that is the will of god to destroy command shepard
现在有一撮geth相信神要灭了指挥官Shepard
that's you
就是 -->你<--
and the other sect believes that it should protect shepard
然而另一撮geth认为他们应当保护Shepard
the player is given the choice to either destory the geth sect that want shepard dead
玩家能够选择 1:消灭那群想要Shepard死的geth
or reprogram them that in such way 
或者 2:改写它们的程序
they share the believes that the group of geth that want to protect you
让他们也觉得你应当受到保护
that they would't even know they've been reprogrammed 
他们甚至都不会知道自己被改写了
So yes ,there's a clear story line qestion being asked 
没错，这是个关系到故事情节的问题


but what really mean asked of us
但是更深层次的,它到底问了什么?
the player here
问的对象就是 -->你<--
on the surface level this is question how you deal with religious fundamentalism
表面上看,这和你如何认识宗教原教旨有关  (??宗教 原教旨????)
it meant to lead consider curent world affairs 
它关系到你如何考虑时事政治
and ask ourselves "are those really the only two-lose solutions ? 
也让我们扪心自问：“只有这两败俱伤的选择吗？
are there option other than total destruction ,
有其他避免彻底毁灭
or the fundamental underming of belief"
或：迫害信仰的方法“???
but there's another question here, a more introspective one 
这还有另一个更发人深省问题
just a series of any question about modem life ,
一系列关于现代生活的问题
if a bit more abstract
更抽象的说


fundamentally the player is being asked , what does it mean to be human ,what does a core of being a sentient being? 
根本上说，问得是这个问题：作为一个人意味着什么？作为一个知觉个体的灵魂是什么？   [core of being ->religious, soul spirit]
this is the same question that philosophers and poets asked thoughtout time
这与哲学家和诗人一直以来问的是同一个问题
we can trace the very question from Aristotle to Milton
我们可以追溯到亚里士多德、米尔顿
we see Hume Nietzsche Descartes and Kant
还有休谟、尼采、笛卡尔、康德  [全靠google images]
it is the question that we as the human beings can't help but ask
作为人类我们都会不由自主地发问
and we do so through every media we have
通过我们能使用的各种媒介
so let's take a closer look how it's being asked here 
所以我们仔细分析一下在这儿是怎么发问的
imaging for a second , that these geth sect is you
想象一下，你就是那些geth
and the belief question is you believed them very strongly 
那些想法也是你深信不疑
or hold very dear
或者死抱着不放的
now image that  someone could take the believe from you
再想象一下，有个家伙能拿走你的想法
say the relation of your father or your believe in the worth of your own individuality

image they can do it without ask you
他们能不告知你就将其夺走
without you evering knowing
你永远不会察觉
without your riligion???? at all
你根本不会发现
imaging that they can wipe away your believe so seriously
他们就能这么笑眯眯地擦除你的信仰
that if you met with former unaltered self you will disagree so violetly that probably couldn't  stand each other
以至于如果你遇到了未被修改的自己，你们会激烈争吵甚至无法忍受对方
now imaging the only way to prevent that from happening was stroggle to the death
你只有一个方法防止这样的悲剧发生：死斗到底
what would you choose?
你会怎么选择？

我宁可抄家伙跟他们干
it's not our free will , our ability to chose our own believes
这不是我们的自由意志，我们选择自己信仰的能力
at core of what makes a human
就人类核心
it is not our ability to overcome our instincts that make a sentient
我们没法克服自己的本能去实现它
what would we be without that

to me, this question also sparks out of force lobotomy
谈到这个，我总提起强制前脑叶白质切除术、
brain-washing re-education
洗脑、精神控制
and yet here this question  were present so reasonablely
在这里它问得如此合情合理
as you playing you might think,
你边玩的时候可能会想：
of course i should rewrite their  belief for their own good 
那当然了，为了他们好，我应当改写他们的程序
you might come to  believe that these faction of  geth  doesn't understand its own evil nature
你甚至会是自己相信这一帮geth自己都不了解自己的劣根性
and you should benevolently try to save them from their clear path to self-destruction 
你出于善举，试图将它们从必然走向灭亡的道路上拯救出来
